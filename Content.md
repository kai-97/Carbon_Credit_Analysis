### Carbon Offset
Carbon Offset is the activity where companies pay for carbon credits to offset their CO2 emissions. These credits are generated by activities that lower the carbon content in the atmosphere. Activities could be reforestation, reducing deforestation, controlling indutrial emissions by enabling sustainable activities. Essentially, any way to reduce carbon significantly could be a good propect of a carbon offset project.
